        <p class="muted">Over the past five years, I have navigated various facets of digital marketing, from hands-on campaign execution to building complex data visualization systems. I created this portfolio to showcase that marketing isn't just about "clicks"—it's about profitable unit economics. I bridge the gap between creative marketing and hard data, ensuring every ad spend is backed by measurable performance.</p>
